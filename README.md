Hello.  Very new to coding but have always been interested.
This past year I started my introduction to coding by using Automation Anywhere at work for automating simple processes in HR/Payroll.
Interested to learn more about coding.
I would love if anyone could assist in providing simple coding techniques, best practices, shortcuts or tips.
